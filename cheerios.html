<h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Your toddler is going to go crazy when they see you pull out the box of cheerios from the cupboard because they are going to enjoy a bowl of deliciousness. And since your toddler is so mindful of taking care of their body, they get to eat this classic meal with an easy mind because they know they are 3 times less likely to develop cardivascular diseases and reduce plaque build up. Good job, Mom! </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>One box of Cheerios (Honey Nut Preffered)</li>
        <li>One cup of lactose-free Milk</li>
        <li>One Spoon (or fork for the spontaneous type)</li>
        <li>One Kellog-themed bowl thats been in your grandma's cupboard for so long nobody knows where it came from</li>
      
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour milk into Kellog-themed bowl.</li>
        <li>Prepare box of cheerios by opening the cardboard flaps of box and carefully open the bag. But not too careful, ensure that you rip the bag down the side so you can no longer roll the bag up and the cereal will go stale in 4-5 days.</li>
        <li>Carefully pour the cereal into the bowl ensuring that 5-6 bits of cereal end up on the floor. Kick the bits of cereal under the cabinets.</li>
        <li>Put the spoon (or fork) in the bowl and enjoy!</li>
        <li>Master Chef Tip: Leave the milk and cereal out just in case you want a second bowl of cereal but forget to put the milk back into the fridge so your wife can yell at you later!</li>
    </ol>
