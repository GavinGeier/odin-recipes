In order to use what I have learned so far in TOP, I had to create a webpage using basic HTML elements, and it had to include headings, paragraphs, ordered lists, unordered lists, image retrieval, and others. 

I was specifically required to create a homepage that had relative links going to three different pages that contained dishes created by myself that included a photo, description, ingredients, and steps. 

I have learned a lot so far and doing this project has ingrained this knowledge into my mind.
