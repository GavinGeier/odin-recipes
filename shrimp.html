<h2 class="subtitle">Description</h2>

    <p> Show these yummy crustaceans who's boss and enjoy a plate of savory honey grilled shrimp! Onions, peppers, and mushrooms are perfect when alternated with shrimp on the skewers. Can be served with rice or salad or a 32 ounce T-bone steak. Do whatever you want, I don't care!  </p>

<h2 class="subtitle">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tablespoon ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>1 pound Large Shrimp, peeled and deveined with tails attached</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of Honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of Butter, melted</li>
        <li>Skewers</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="subtitle">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>With your father, embark on an <em>epic</em> adventure aboard a shrimping boat and don't come home until you've held captive at least one pound of shrimp. Or go to your local Giant Eagle and head over to the Seafood Section.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together garlic powder, black pepper, and worcestershire; add shrimp and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to high heat. Thread shrimp onto skewers, piercing once near the tail and once near the head. Discard marinade.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, stir together honey, and melted butter. Set aside for basting.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil the grill grate. Grill shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until opaque. Baste occasionally with the honey-butter sauce while grilling.</li>

    </ol>
