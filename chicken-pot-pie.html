        <li>1 pound of Boneless Chicken</li>
        <li>1 cup of Peas</li>
        <li>1 cup of Carrots</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of chopped Onions</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sliced Celery</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of Butter</li>
        <li>1/3 cup of All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of Salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of Black Pepper</li>
        <li>2/3 cup of Milk</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cup of Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>2 (9inch) Pie Crusts</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the heat and drain.</li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed.</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in chicken broth and milk.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid mixture over top.</li>
        <li>Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
